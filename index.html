        <div class-"about-content">
        <p> Hi, my name is Corbin Kling, I am studying structural geology with an emphasis in planetary science. 
            My masters work was focused on investigating large thrust faults on Mars and if they could inform us more 
            about the subsurface crustal properties. My Ph.D. work has been focused on how pit craters form on Earth, Mars, 
            and any planetary surface that host these enigmatic sinkhole-like geomorphological features. </p>

        <p> My most recent work has included:</p>
            <ol>
            <li> Using drone data to estimate short-timescale movement of dunes. tracking dune movement with drones is a much improved
                method to previously used differential GPS surveys. Coupling drone data with novel point cloud comparision techniques 
                allows for accuracte estimation of dune movement without the need for time sconsuming ground control point surveys 
                conveintionally used in drone data processing. The field sites for dune tracking aare located in the Simpson Desert, 
                Australia.</li>
            <li> A large mapping project studying how pit craters influenced the formation Noctis Labyrinthus, Mars. I have mapped 
                all normal faults, impact craters, and pit craters within Noctis Labyrnithus, Mars. Additionally I have found abundant 
                evidence for periglacial processes post emplacement of the pit craters indicating some large volatile reservoir 
                was present within the subsurface.</li>
            <li> Three field campaigns to look at pit craters on Earth; Hawaii Volcanoes National Park , Craters of the Moon National 
                Monument and Preserve, and Canyonlands National Park. This wowrk was to supplememtn observations of pit craters made 
                on other planets, including at Noctis Labyrinthus, Mars, Nyx Mons, Venus, and numerous small satellites.</li>
